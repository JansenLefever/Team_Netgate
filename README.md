# Team_NETGAINS

THE PLAN:

Start with the mindset of: Evaluating the scared and the unscared. Feelings are valid, the reasons may not be.

For contrubtions efforts: Regular meetups, daily agreed upon plans for that days effort. Reaching out on the hour. For every team meeting, we all must say something, even if it's just "I have nothing to say."

Course of action: Take a breather, come back with "I" statements. Nothing can't be said. 

Work plan: Git's projects board.
